The Children of the Obsidian Sun (COTOS for short) are a cult that are focusing on condensing energy for the use of bringing back [[Erres Gavas]]. These efforts are stationed in a variety of cities around the Utheakar Empire. Often lining up with the Ley Lines of the world itself.

There are 5 main bases of operations in the Utheakar Empire
1. [[Avanza COTOS Base]]
2. [[Birodal COTOS Base]]
3. [[Grashmere Mines COTOS Base]]
4. [[Karini COTOS Base]]
5. [[Vezelyes Wilds COTOS Base]]

These bases are a mixture of large, run down buildings, subterranean interconnected tunnels, and the largest base up in the Veszelyes Wilds, which is a hidden base of operations, and a possible encounter location for [[Farsen Syl'ran]].
