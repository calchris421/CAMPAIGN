The age of the Starfall was a period of magical dominance. This period of time was largely referred also as the Age of Arcanum but was given the moniker "The Age of Starfall" due to the reports of gifts from the gods in the form of meteors which created the magic powers which seeped into the lands of Pol'estria at the beginning of this time period.

- Period of time: ~6100 years
- Dates: ~6100 P.C. - 13 P.C.

## Historical Events
### The Rise of Xyrona
- Xyrona is a lost civilization in the modern times, but during the Age of Starfall, it's rise was given largely through the efforts of those imbued with the magic empowerment of those who wanted to take the world into their own hands.

Many people were said to hold power in this civilization, but records of leadership are incongruent. This lack of congruent leadership led to the eventual fall of the Xyronian empire.

Within a decade of its inception, an incursion was held against the Xyronian empire led by [[Erres Gavas]], who found a method of invoking enough magical power to create a near stasis of immortality. His rise to power brought about the Gavasian empire

### The Gavasian Empire
Under the Rule of [[Erres Gavas]], the factions of the continent began to forge an alliance fueled by the need for trade due to the harsh winters of the Ikarethian continent. Gavas held monthly meetings which were possible due to the use of teleportation circles which he has contracted to be put in every major city in the continent.

[[Erres Gavas]] was a very paranoid individual, as he kept his secret of immortality a secret from those in power around him, fearing that if others came to know of it's solution. he would be killed for its power. His own paranoia led him to create a secret society of scientists tasked with researching ways to increase his power, spies who were tasked with finding rats in his power structure, and mercenaries who were tasked with his protection, this coalition of people was known as the [[Ikarethian Society]].

Eventually, Gavas felt his only method in which to stay in power forever was to forego the will of the gods. Fueled by the idea of his own preservation, he reorganized his efforts to focus on consolidating as much power into a single person as possible.
### The Fall of Ikareth
	"Stand with me, for today we defy the very heavens themselves! We shall forge our legend in the annals of history, not as those who cowered in the face of impossibility, but as those who defied it with unyielding determination. Let the gods themselves tremble at our audacity, for we are the architects of our destiny, and the impossible is but a challenge we embrace!" - Erres Gavas just prior to the Calamity

The gods attempted to reach out to Gavas, prompting him with an ultimatum, stop his attempts as harnessing the power of the gods, or face complete and total destruction. This threw Erres Gavas into a spiral, making him descend into madness.

Within just a few more years the Ikarethian Society completed the construction of a massive beast of arcane technology known as the Deity's Bane. This machine was meant to target a god for their power, sap it into a single individual, and essentially swap places with them. There is no knowledge as to which god Gavas intended to target, just that his madness, and thirst for power wanted any god to fall in his wake.

When the machine powered up, it send shockwaves through the continent of Ikareth, and led the breakout of a war which was known as [[The Cataclysm]].
