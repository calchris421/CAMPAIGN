### **The Fall**

- **The Fracturing Within** — The visions from the Ember Crown began to contradict one another, showing multiple, mutually exclusive futures. The Emberlords turned on each other, each convinced their path was the “true” destiny.
    
- **The Curse of the Crown** — It is said the gods, weary of Xyrona’s defiance, twisted the magic of the shards. The more the Emberlords used them, the more their bodies burned from within, until their veins glowed like molten glass.
    
- **The Night of Seven Ashes** — In a single night, Veythra’s seven Emberlords fought each other in the streets. The city’s meteor core erupted, consuming the capital in a pillar of fire visible for hundreds of miles.
    
- **The Scattering** — Survivors fled into the wilds, carrying fragments of Xyrona’s magic. The Ember Crown was lost — some say shattered, others say hidden in the Sea of Mists.
