## **The First Open Challenge** _(~2,700–2,900 AS)_

**Tone:** Defiance, spectacle, and the first taste of war.

- **The Duel of the Sky-Cities** — Xyrona’s champion defeats a Nine Thrones’ Archon in single combat, shattering the illusion of their invincibility.
    
- **The Shard Proclamation** — The Emberlords declare that all Starfall sites belong to _all mortals_, not just the Thrones.
    
- **The Siege of Calvess** — Xyrona attempts to seize the shard-trade hub; though repelled, they prove they can match the Thrones in open battle.
    
- **The Crimson Banner Raised** — Xyrona’s armies march under a new standard: a burning crown over a field of black glass. The Great Game is no longer covert.
