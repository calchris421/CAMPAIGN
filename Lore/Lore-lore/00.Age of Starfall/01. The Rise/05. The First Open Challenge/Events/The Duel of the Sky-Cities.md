_~2,880 AS — The moment Xyrona proves it can match the Nine Thrones in open combat._

**Atmosphere:** Two floating cities drift toward each other over the Shardsea, their hulls bristling with shard-cannons. The duel will be fought between champions on a suspended glass platform, with the world watching from airships and cliffside amphitheaters.

**Key NPCs:**

- **Champion Rhaekos Veythra** — Xyrona’s chosen, clad in armor that glows with molten veins.
    
- **Archon Serathiel Dawnspire** — The Thrones’ duelist, wielding a blade of pure starlight.
    
- **The Ember Crown Bearer** — Watching from the shadows, whispering visions to Rhaekos mid-fight.
    

**Player Hooks:**

- PCs could be part of the champion’s honor guard, saboteurs sent to tilt the duel, or smugglers moving contraband under the cover of the spectacle.
    
- The duel’s outcome could hinge on a single unnoticed intervention.
    

**Decision Points:**

- Interfere with the duel subtly — a gust of wind, a shard’s resonance shifted at the right moment.
    
- Protect the bearer of the Ember Crown from an assassination attempt mid-match.
    
- Choose whether to let the duel end in victory, defeat, or a scandalous draw.
