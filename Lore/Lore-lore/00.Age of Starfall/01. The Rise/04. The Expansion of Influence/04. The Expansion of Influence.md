**Tone:** Ambition, diplomacy, and shadowed conquest.

- **The Shard Trade Network** — Xyrona brokers shard-forged goods to distant lands, undercutting Nine Thrones’ prices.
    
- **The Ember Envoys** — Charismatic emissaries spread Xyrona’s creed: _Power belongs to those who seize it, not those born to it._
    
- **The Quiet Annexations** — Border towns “invite” Xyrona’s protection in exchange for shardcraft technology.
    
- **The Ember Crown’s Whispers** — The visions grow more insistent, showing not just futures, but _paths_ to make them real.
