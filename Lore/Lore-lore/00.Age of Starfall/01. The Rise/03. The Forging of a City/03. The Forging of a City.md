## **The Forging of a City** _(~2,050–2,300 AS)_

**Tone:** Determination, ingenuity, and the birth of a culture.

- **The Founding of Xyrona** — Built into the cliffs above the meteor’s crater, Xyrona is designed as both fortress and forge.
    
- **The Emberforges** — Using shard energy, the Emberlords create forges that can shape meteoric glass into weapons, armor, and arcane conduits.
    
- **The Ash Markets** — Traders from the Glasswastes and Verdant Shards arrive, drawn by the promise of shardcraft goods.
    
- **The First Ember Trials** — A brutal rite where aspirants must survive a night in the crater’s heart, enduring visions and shardstorms. Those who return are forever changed.
