**Also known as:** _The Day the Ash Held_

### **What Happened**

Barely a generation after the Founding of Xyrona, the Nine Thrones — alarmed by the city’s rapid growth and its monopoly on shardcraft — send a coalition of mercenary companies and loyalist mages to seize the Emberforges. Their approach is through the only navigable pass into the crater: Shardfall Gate, a narrow basalt defile carved by ancient meteor impact.

For twelve days, the defenders — a mix of Emberlords, Ashbound militia, and traders who refused to abandon their goods — hold the pass against overwhelming numbers. The Emberforges are pushed to their limits, producing weapons and armor in real time for the fighters above. On the thirteenth day, a shardstorm sweeps through the canyon, scattering the attackers and sealing the pass under tons of glassy debris.

### **Atmosphere**

- The Gate is a jagged wound in the cliffside, its walls glittering with embedded shard fragments that catch the light like frozen lightning.
    
- The air during the siege was thick with the smell of burning shardwood and the metallic tang of blood.
    
- At night, the defenders lit the pass with shard-lanterns, their glow refracting into eerie constellations on the canyon walls.
    

### **Political & Cultural Ripples**

- The Siege becomes the **foundational myth** of Xyrona’s resilience — the phrase _“The Ash Held”_ becomes a rallying cry in future wars.
    
- The debris from the shardstorm is left in place, turning Shardfall Gate into both a monument and a natural barrier.
    
- The Nine Thrones shift from direct confrontation to covert sabotage and espionage, realizing brute force won’t break Xyrona.
    
- The Emberforges gain near-religious significance, seen as the “heart” that kept the city alive.
    

### **Physical Remnants**

- **The Glassfall Wall** — the fused shardstorm debris that still seals the old pass, now carved with the names of every known defender.
    
- **The Emberforged Pike** — a weapon said to have been reforged three times during the siege, each time in the middle of battle, still bearing scorch marks from the forges.
