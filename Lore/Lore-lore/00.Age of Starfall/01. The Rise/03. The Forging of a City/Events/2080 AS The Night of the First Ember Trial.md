_~2,080 AS — Xyrona is still a half-built cliffside fortress, its streets lit by shard-lanterns and forge-fire._

**Atmosphere:** The crater below churns with shardstorms — arcs of molten glass and violet lightning. The air smells of scorched stone and ozone. Above, the Emberlords watch from a basalt balcony, their faces hidden behind masks of meteoric glass.

**Key NPCs:**

- **Lord Kaevryn Ashmantle** — Emberlord, voice like rolling embers, believes fear is the truest teacher.
    
- **Veyra the Hollow-Eyed** — A survivor of the first trial, her skin faintly translucent from shard exposure.
    
- **The Aspirants** — A mix of desperate exiles, ambitious mages, and one suspiciously well-fed “merchant’s son” who doesn’t belong.
    

**Player Hooks:**

- PCs could be aspirants themselves, guards ensuring no one flees, or spies sent to witness the ritual.
    
- The trial’s visions can be tailored to each PC’s fears or desires — a perfect moment to plant personal foreshadowing.
    

**Decision Points:**

- Aid or sabotage another aspirant mid-trial.
    
- Interfere with the shardstorm to save someone — risking the wrath of the Emberlords.
    
- Steal a fragment from the crater while chaos reigns.
