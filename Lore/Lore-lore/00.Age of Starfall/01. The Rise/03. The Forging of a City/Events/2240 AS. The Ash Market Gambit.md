_~2,240 AS — Xyrona’s markets are swelling with traders from the Glasswastes, Verdant Shards, and beyond._

**Atmosphere:** A canyon-spanning bazaar of black glass bridges and ropewalks, lit by molten shard-forges. The air is thick with spice smoke, hot metal, and the sound of haggling in a dozen tongues. Above, banners of the burning crown ripple in the updraft.

**Key NPCs:**

- **Tassik “Three Tongues”** — A Glasswaste trader who can speak to anyone, but never tells the same story twice.
    
- **High Broker Selune Varr** — Oversees all shardcraft trade; calculating, velvet-voiced, and utterly ruthless.
    
- **The Verdant Envoy** — A druid in living crystal armor, here to negotiate a dangerous shard-for-forest exchange.
    

**Player Hooks:**

- PCs could be hired to guard a high-value shard shipment, or to sabotage a rival’s deal.
    
- A Nine Thrones agent is here in disguise, trying to buy Xyrona’s loyalty — or assassinate a broker.
    

**Decision Points:**

- Broker a deal that could shift the balance of power between factions.
    
- Expose (or protect) the disguised Thrones agent.
    
- Decide whether to let a cursed shard slip into circulation.
