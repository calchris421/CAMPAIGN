## **The Embers in the Dark** _(~1,800–2,050 AS)_

**Tone:** Survival, grit, and the first sparks of identity.

- **The Outcast Exodus** — Disgraced mages, mercenaries, and visionaries denied seats among the Nine Thrones drift into the frontier.
    
- **The Ember Crown’s Discovery** — In the basalt canyons of Veythra, a meteor shard unlike any other is unearthed — not a single crystal, but a _crown_ of fused fragments, each humming with a different resonance.
    
- **The Pact of Ash and Blood** — The shard’s finders swear an oath: no one will wear the Crown alone. It will be passed among them in ritual, binding their fates together.
    
- **The First Emberlords** — Those who bear the Crown gain visions of possible futures, each more intoxicating than the last. They begin calling themselves Emberlords, and their followers, the Ashbound.
