## **The Outcast Exodus** _(~1,800–1,825 AS)_

**What Happened:** The Nine Thrones, in their age of consolidation, purge their ranks of “unreliable” elements — mages who question doctrine, mercenaries who refuse to bend to court politics, visionaries whose ideas threaten the status quo. These exiles drift into the frontier, following rumors of unclaimed shardlands in the basalt canyons of Veythra.

**Atmosphere:** Caravans of mismatched wagons creak through wind-scoured passes. The air smells of iron and dust. At night, campfires burn low, and every shadow feels like it might be a predator — or a spy from the Thrones.

**Political & Cultural Ripples:**

- The frontier becomes a melting pot of magical traditions, mercenary codes, and outlaw honor.
    
- Early alliances are forged not out of trust, but necessity — survival over ideology.
    
- The Nine Thrones quietly monitor the exiles, assuming they’ll die in the wastes.
