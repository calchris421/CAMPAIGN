## **The First Emberlords** _(~1,835–2,050 AS)_

**What Happened:** Those who bear the Crown begin to see visions — not fixed prophecies, but branching futures, each more intoxicating than the last. Some show Xyrona as a beacon of unity; others, as a conqueror draped in ash. The bearers take the title **Emberlord**, and their followers, drawn by charisma and the promise of destiny, become the Ashbound.

**Atmosphere:** When the Crown rests on a brow, the air thickens, colors sharpen, and the bearer’s eyes reflect constellations no one can name. Their voice carries a resonance that makes even skeptics lean closer.

**Political & Cultural Ripples:**

- The Ashbound begin carving out territory in the frontier, defending it fiercely from both the Nine Thrones and rival shard-seekers.
    
- The Emberlords’ visions start to influence settlement planning, trade routes, and even the timing of festivals.
    
- The Nine Thrones begin to see Xyrona not as a nuisance, but as a potential rival.
    

**Adventure Hooks:**

- PCs could be tasked with verifying whether a current Emberlord’s vision is genuine or manipulated.
    
- A lost “branch” of the Ashbound, descended from an early vision, might reappear with their own interpretation of the Crown’s destiny.
