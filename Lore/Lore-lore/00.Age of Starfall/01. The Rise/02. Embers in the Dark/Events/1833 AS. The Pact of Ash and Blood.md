**What Happened:** The shard’s finders — a mage, a sellsword, and a wandering seer — swear an oath: no one will wear the Crown alone. It will be passed among them in ritual, each bearer holding it for a single lunar cycle before yielding it to the next. The pact is sealed in blood over a fire of burning shardwood, the smoke curling into shapes that seem to watch.

**Atmosphere:** The canyon wind howls through narrow passes as the three kneel around the emberfire. The Crown sits between them, its glow shifting to match the rhythm of their heartbeats.

**Political & Cultural Ripples:**

- The ritual becomes the foundation of Emberlord succession — a rotating stewardship that prevents (for now) a single tyrant from claiming the Crown.
    
- Outsiders begin calling them “the Ashbound” for the soot-stained cloaks they wear after the ritual.
    
- The pact’s secrecy fuels rumors of dark magic and forbidden bargains.
    

**Adventure Hooks:**

- PCs could be asked to recover the original shardwood brazier, now in the hands of a rival cult.
    
- A break in the ritual cycle centuries later could be the catalyst for a major political crisis.
