## **The Ember Crown’s Discovery** _(~1,832 AS)_

**What Happened:** In the deepest chasm of Veythra, a shard-hunting party uncovers something unprecedented: not a single meteor crystal, but a circlet of fused fragments, each humming with a different resonance. The air around it vibrates faintly, and touching it floods the mind with alien impressions — starlit cities, burning skies, and voices speaking in languages no one knows.

**Atmosphere:** The basalt walls glisten with shardlight. The Crown rests half-buried in black sand, its fragments pulsing in an irregular rhythm, like a heartbeat that doesn’t belong to this world.

**Political & Cultural Ripples:**

- The finders hide the Crown from the wider camp, fearing it will be stolen or destroyed.
    
- Word leaks anyway, drawing fortune-seekers, cultists, and assassins to Veythra.
    
- The Nine Thrones dispatch “surveyors” — spies in all but name — to investigate.
