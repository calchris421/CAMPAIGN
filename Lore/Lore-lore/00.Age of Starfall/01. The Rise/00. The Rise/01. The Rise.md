### **The Rise**

- **The Crimson Ascendancy** — Xyrona’s mage-lords, known as the **Emberlords**, wielded magic that was raw, volatile, and deeply personal — unlike the refined, codified spells of the Nine Thrones. Their magic was fueled by willpower and ambition, making them unpredictable in battle.
    
- **The Conquest of the Shardlands** — Over two centuries, Xyrona expanded aggressively, seizing lesser Starfall sites and absorbing their magic into the Ember Crown.
    
- **The City of Seven Flames** — Their capital, _Veythra_, was built around a colossal meteor crater. At night, the streets glowed with drifting motes of starlight, and the air shimmered with heat from the magical core beneath the city.
    
- **The Philosophy of Dominion** — Xyrona’s creed held that the gods had given mortals the meteors not as gifts, but as _tests_. To seize power was to prove oneself worthy of shaping the world.
