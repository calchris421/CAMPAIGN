### **The Apex**

- **The Emberlord’s Challenge** — Xyrona openly defied the Nine Thrones, declaring that the Archons were “keepers of chains” who feared true freedom.
    
- **The War of the Burning Skies** — A century-long conflict between Xyrona and the Nine Thrones saw entire regions turned to glass and ash. Xyrona’s armies were infamous for their _Shardforged_ — warriors clad in armor infused with meteor magic, capable of tearing through spell and steel alike.
    
- **The Seventh Flame** — The final shard was added to the Ember Crown, granting its wearer visions of possible futures. This allowed Xyrona to outmaneuver enemies for decades.
