#### **Xyrona — The Ember Crowned Realm**

_Expansionist Meteor-Mage Empire_

- **Seat of Power:** Veythra, the City of Seven Flames.
    
- **Philosophy:** The meteors were not gifts but tests — only those strong enough to seize them deserved to rule.
    
- **Strengths:**
    
    - Shardforged armies with unpredictable, willpower-driven magic.
        
    - The Ember Crown — a relic of seven meteor shards granting visions of possible futures.
        
- **Weaknesses:**
    
    - Volatile leadership; visions from the Crown caused paranoia and infighting.
        
    - Magic was raw and unstable, leading to environmental devastation.
        
- **Relations:** Bitter enemies of the Nine Thrones; occasional alliances with rogue mage orders and mercenary states.
