#### **The Nine Thrones**: An Overview

_Loose Confederation of Archon-ruled City-States_

- **Seat of Power:** Each throne was tied to a major Starfall site, with its own capital.
    
- **Philosophy:** Magic is a divine trust, to be studied, refined, and shared under the guidance of the most gifted.
    
- **Strengths:**
    
    - Highly organized magical academies.
        
    - Floating cities and Starforges.
        
    - A network of teleportation gates linking their realms.
        
- **Weaknesses:**
    
    - Rivalries between Archons often undermined unity.
        
    - Over-reliance on stable meteor magic made them vulnerable when it began to wane.
        
- **Relations:** Initially cooperative with smaller states, but became increasingly authoritarian as they tried to control all Starfall sites.
