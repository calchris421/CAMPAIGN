The age of the Starfall was a period of magical dominance. This period of time was largely referred also as the Age of Arcanum but was given the moniker "The Age of Starfall" due to the reports of gifts from the gods in the form of meteors which created the magic powers which seeped into the lands of Pol'estria at the beginning of this time period.

- Period of time: ~6100 years
- Dates: ~6100 P.C. - 13 P.C.

## Historical Events
### The Rise of Xyrona
- Xyrona is a lost civilization in the modern times, but during the Age of Starfall, it's rise was given largely through the efforts of those imbued with the magic empowerment of those who wanted to take the world into their own hands.

Many people were said to hold power in this civilization, but records of leadership are incongruent. This lack of congruent leadership led to the eventual fall of the Xyronian empire.

##  **Xyrona — The Ember Crowned Realm**

**Era of Dominance:** c. 2,900–5,100 AS (_After Starfall_) **Modern Status:** Lost civilization; ruins scattered in the Glasswastes and the Verdant Shards.

### **Origins**

- **The Spark of Ambition** — Xyrona began as a loose confederation of frontier settlements far from the Nine Thrones’ influence. When a cluster of _lesser meteors_ fell in their lands, the shards were claimed not by Archons, but by ambitious warlords, scholars, and outcasts who had been denied power in the great city-states.
    
- **The Pact of the Ember Crown** — These empowered leaders swore an oath to “take the world into their own hands,” rejecting divine will and the authority of the Archons. They forged the Ember Crown, a circlet set with seven meteor shards, as a symbol of their unity and defiance.
    

### **The Rise**

- **The Crimson Ascendancy** — Xyrona’s mage-lords, known as the **Emberlords**, wielded magic that was raw, volatile, and deeply personal — unlike the refined, codified spells of the Nine Thrones. Their magic was fueled by willpower and ambition, making them unpredictable in battle.
    
- **The Conquest of the Shardlands** — Over two centuries, Xyrona expanded aggressively, seizing lesser Starfall sites and absorbing their magic into the Ember Crown.
    
- **The City of Seven Flames** — Their capital, _Veythra_, was built around a colossal meteor crater. At night, the streets glowed with drifting motes of starlight, and the air shimmered with heat from the magical core beneath the city.
    
- **The Philosophy of Dominion** — Xyrona’s creed held that the gods had given mortals the meteors not as gifts, but as _tests_. To seize power was to prove oneself worthy of shaping the world.
    

### **The Apex**

- **The Emberlord’s Challenge** — Xyrona openly defied the Nine Thrones, declaring that the Archons were “keepers of chains” who feared true freedom.
    
- **The War of the Burning Skies** — A century-long conflict between Xyrona and the Nine Thrones saw entire regions turned to glass and ash. Xyrona’s armies were infamous for their _Shardforged_ — warriors clad in armor infused with meteor magic, capable of tearing through spell and steel alike.
    
- **The Seventh Flame** — The final shard was added to the Ember Crown, granting its wearer visions of possible futures. This allowed Xyrona to outmaneuver enemies for decades.
    

### **The Fall**

- **The Fracturing Within** — The visions from the Ember Crown began to contradict one another, showing multiple, mutually exclusive futures. The Emberlords turned on each other, each convinced their path was the “true” destiny.
    
- **The Curse of the Crown** — It is said the gods, weary of Xyrona’s defiance, twisted the magic of the shards. The more the Emberlords used them, the more their bodies burned from within, until their veins glowed like molten glass.
    
- **The Night of Seven Ashes** — In a single night, Veythra’s seven Emberlords fought each other in the streets. The city’s meteor core erupted, consuming the capital in a pillar of fire visible for hundreds of miles.
    
- **The Scattering** — Survivors fled into the wilds, carrying fragments of Xyrona’s magic. The Ember Crown was lost — some say shattered, others say hidden in the Sea of Mists.
    

### **Legacy in the Modern Age**

- **Ruins** — The Glasswastes are littered with half-melted towers and fused streets where Xyrona’s magic burned too hot.
    
- **Relics** — Shardforged armor and weapons still surface in black markets, though most are unstable and dangerous to wield.
    
- **Whispers** — Utheakarian scholars believe the Ember Crown still exists and could be reforged; Dreavwyth priests warn that doing so would invite divine wrath.
    
- **Cultural Echoes** — In some outlaw circles, “Xyronan” is still used as a word for someone who takes what they want without waiting for permission.

Near the fall of , an incursion was held against the Xyronian empire led by [[Erres Gavas]], who found a method of invoking enough magical power to create a near stasis of immortality. His rise to power brought about the Gavasian empire

### The Gavasian Empire
Under the Rule of [[Erres Gavas]], the factions of the continent began to forge an alliance fueled by the need for trade due to the harsh winters of the Ikarethian continent. Gavas held monthly meetings which were possible due to the use of teleportation circles which he has contracted to be put in every major city in the continent.

[[Erres Gavas]] was a very paranoid individual, as he kept his secret of immortality a secret from those in power around him, fearing that if others came to know of it's solution. he would be killed for its power. His own paranoia led him to create a secret society of scientists tasked with researching ways to increase his power, spies who were tasked with finding rats in his power structure, and mercenaries who were tasked with his protection, this coalition of people was known as the [[Ikarethian Society]].

Eventually, Gavas felt his only method in which to stay in power forever was to forego the will of the gods. Fueled by the idea of his own preservation, he reorganized his efforts to focus on consolidating as much power into a single person as possible.
### The Fall of Ikareth
	"Stand with me, for today we defy the very heavens themselves! We shall forge our legend in the annals of history, not as those who cowered in the face of impossibility, but as those who defied it with unyielding determination. Let the gods themselves tremble at our audacity, for we are the architects of our destiny, and the impossible is but a challenge we embrace!" - Erres Gavas just prior to the Calamity

The gods attempted to reach out to Gavas, prompting him with an ultimatum, stop his attempts as harnessing the power of the gods, or face complete and total destruction. This threw Erres Gavas into a spiral, making him descend into madness.

Within just a few more years the Ikarethian Society completed the construction of a massive beast of arcane technology known as the Deity's Bane. This machine was meant to target a god for their power, sap it into a single individual, and essentially swap places with them. There is no knowledge as to which god Gavas intended to target, just that his madness, and thirst for power wanted any god to fall in his wake.

When the machine powered up, it send shockwaves through the continent of Ikareth, and led the breakout of a war which was known as [[The Cataclysm]].
