_(c. 18,000–12,000 years before present)_

## **Phase I — The Dawn of Falling Stars** (0–1,200 AS)

**Tone:** Wonder, unity, and the first seeds of rivalry.

- **The First Gift** — A colossal meteor lands in the Vale of Luthien, its shards granting mortals the first true arcane powers.
    
- **The Rain of Wonders** — Over the next century, more meteors fall across Pol’estria. Each impact site becomes a cradle of civilization.
    
- **The Covenant of Nine Thrones** — Nine Archons, each tied to a major Starfall site, form a loose magical confederation to share knowledge and prevent hoarding.
    
- **The Verdant Shard Awakens** — In the deep south, a meteor fuses with an ancient forest, birthing the crystalline paradise later known as the Verdant Shards. Druids begin to gather there, forming the first shard-touched enclaves.
    
- **The First Outcasts** — Ambitious mages and warriors denied seats among the Nine Thrones begin to drift toward the frontier — the seeds of Xyrona’s founders.
    

## **Phase II — The High Arcanum** (1,200–2,900 AS)

- **The Rise of the Emberlords** — In the frontier, a cluster of lesser meteors falls. Those who claim them — exiles, mercenaries, and visionaries — form the Pact of the Ember Crown, founding **Xyrona**.

- **The First Immortals** — Archons and Emberlords alike begin binding their souls to meteor shards, halting their aging.
    
- **The Quiet Heresy** — The Starborn Orders split — some claim the meteors are divine gifts, others that they are weapons from a god-war.
    

## **Phase III — The Crimson Ascendancy** (2,900–3,800 AS)

**Tone:** Expansion, ideological clash, and the first great war.

- **The Nine Thrones’ Alarm** — The Archons declare Xyrona a rogue state, accusing it of destabilizing the magical balance.

## **Phase IV — The Fracturing** (3,800–5,200 AS)

- **The Sundering of the Sky-Cities** — Once-united floating metropolises turn their weapons on each other, raining destruction on the lands below.
    
- **The Blight of Glass** — Overuse of meteor magic in warfare crystallizes vast regions into the **Glasswastes**.

## **Phase V — The Twilight of Starfall** (5,200–6,000 AS)

**Tone:** Collapse, exodus, and the seeds of the next age.

- **The Night of Seven Ashes** — Xyrona’s Emberlords destroy each other in Veythra. The city’s meteor core erupts, creating the central Glasswaste crater.
    
- **The Last Gift** — A final, colossal meteor falls into the Sea of Mists, causing tidal waves and storms that drown entire coastal kingdoms.
    
- **The Great Severing** — The gods withdraw their favor; meteor magic begins to wane. Floating cities crash, Starforges fail, and the Nine Thrones dissolve.
    
- **The Exodus** — Survivors scatter. The Verdant Shards close themselves off entirely. The Aetherbound Guilds retreat to hidden skyports.
    
- **The Closing of the Age** — The last Archon, Seraphel the Luminous, vanishes with the largest surviving shard. Her disappearance marks the official end of the Age of Starfall.
