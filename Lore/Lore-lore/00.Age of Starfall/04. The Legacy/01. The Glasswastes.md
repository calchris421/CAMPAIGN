## 🪞 **The Glasswastes**

**Origin:** Born in the final centuries of the Age of Starfall, when Xyrona’s Emberlords unleashed meteor-fueled magic in the War of the Burning Skies. Entire regions were flash-fused into glass by spells that burned hotter than the sun.

### **Geography & Appearance**

- **Endless Mirrors** — The land is a jagged expanse of black, green, and violet glass, fractured into knife-edged ridges and vast, flat plains that reflect the sky in warped, dizzying patterns.
    
- **The Singing Wind** — When storms sweep across the wastes, the wind howls through the cracks in the glass, producing eerie, flute-like tones that can carry for miles.
    
- **The Sun’s Wrath** — Daylight here is blinding; travelers must shield their eyes or risk snow-blindness from the glare.
    

### **Hazards**

- **Glassstorms** — Shards whipped into the air by sudden gales can flay flesh from bone.
    
- **Heat Wells** — Pockets of trapped magical heat beneath the surface can erupt without warning, melting boots — or worse.
    
- **Residual Magic** — Some glass formations hum with unstable Starfall energy, warping time or space in their vicinity.
    

### **Legends & Hooks**

- **The Seven Shadows** — Said to be the burned souls of Xyrona’s Emberlords, glimpsed as silhouettes walking the horizon.
    
- **The Crown’s Reflection** — Folklore claims that if one stands at the exact center of the wastes at midnight, the surface will show the location of the lost Ember Crown.
    
- **Modern Interest** — Utheakarian arcanists mine the wastes for “glassstone,” a rare magical conductor, while Dreavwyth knights see it as cursed ground that should remain untouched.
