### **Legacy in the Modern Age**

- **Ruins** — The Glasswastes are littered with half-melted towers and fused streets where Xyrona’s magic burned too hot.
    
- **Relics** — Shardforged armor and weapons still surface in black markets, though most are unstable and dangerous to wield.
    
- **Whispers** — Utheakarian scholars believe the Ember Crown still exists and could be reforged; Dreavwyth priests warn that doing so would invite divine wrath.
    
- **Cultural Echoes** — In some outlaw circles, “Xyronan” is still used as a word for someone who takes what they want without waiting for permission.
