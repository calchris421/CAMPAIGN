***Actions***

***Quarterstaff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Fey Charm.*** The fey targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the fey, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 minute. The charmed target obeys the fey's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fey's Fey Charm for the next 24 hours. The fey can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.
