Arlen was a long time partner of Erres Gavas and is still to this day a ring leader in the efforts to bring him back. 

### The Gavasian Empire

During his early entrance into the planar realm, Arlen was a very simple fey, his age had just yet reached an even age of 320 years old when he stepped foot into the realm of Ikareth. He spent much of his early time swindling traveling merchants by taking their goods while they were not looking.

During this time, he was still extremely powerful, and was noticed by an up and coming noble, [[Erres Gavas]]. Gavas and Syl'ran took a quick liking to each other. Gavas, hungry in his power made a deal with Farsys that forever linked their destinies. This was that in the total annihilation of one would result in the total annihilation of the other.

As Gavas rose to power within the Ikarethian peninsula, Farsys was allowed to partake in all of his devious curiosities. This made him increasingly more powerful as he was able to create a multitude of power banks which increased his power. These find their home within the fey wild to this day. 

### Erres Gavas falls

Near the end of the Calamity, Erres Gavas was killed, or so many thought. Farsys knew that in the event of his total annihilation (which many had thought to have happened) he would also be totally destroyed. This meant he knew that he was likely to have been destroyed at the same time, meaning he knows of the existence of Gavas still being alive, or at least in existence.

The fall of Gavas prompted the mad scientist to go into hiding, where he initially took up the moniker Arlen Farsys
