Beginning of the Cataclysm
	In the time before modern day. (Pre-Sol 0) the [[Gavasian Empire]] was the epicenter of the Cataclysm. Though not much is known about the source of the cataclysm. The power of the country is said to be the source of their empire being chosen as the center of the cataclysm

### The Trigger:
The Cataclysm of this realm was triggered by the actions of a mysterious figure known as "Ikareth". He was known to be power hungry, constantly temperamental, and very *very* prideful. His cause of death is unknown.

	*Note: Cataclysms typically come from overambition. Many know stories of kings and wizards attempting to take on the power of gods to usurp their thrones, only to be struck down before their acension can take place, Either by gods, through power and destruction, or quietly, through their own peoples.*

In Sol -1, Emperor Ikareth was looking to increase his power more than it was already at. Even though his kingdom stretched into much of the Uthekarian Continent. This power led to many questionable studies, many inhumane experiments and the death of his own people. Ikareth's own paranoia led him to even kill his own wife. Queen Uthea.

### Ground Zero
The Capital of Gavasian was the epicenter of the Cataclysm, and the area is destroyed to this day.

### Post Cataclysm Efforts
Many of the people who tried to do cleanup work following the cataclysm typically died. Many other became very sick, and battled sickness for months before either succumbing to their illnesses or living very limited lives fraught with weakness and sickness. Many of the only people who did not have medical problems following visiting were magically inclined, or had assistance from those who did, particularly those of Clerical Medicines of Paladins.
