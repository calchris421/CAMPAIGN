  Capital of the [[Gavasian Empire]]

One thing the Crazed Emperor worried the most about was the stability of his own Kingdom. This led him to build his city in the center of the Uthekarian Peninsula.

The empires peak brought a lush land and an absurd amount of prosperity to the peoples of the Gavasian empire, or so many thought. The capital of Gavasian was a place of much wealth to be sure, but many slums peppered the sprawling city, many abandon. Where these poorer people went, is completely unknown.

	Local legends claim that many of the people within the city who did not achieve a certain status of wealth were shipped off to other countries as refugees. Others claim that they were killed on the spot if they were homeless, other claimed mysterious tales of their family members disappearing and hearing they were fed to a beast kept under the city for its protection.
