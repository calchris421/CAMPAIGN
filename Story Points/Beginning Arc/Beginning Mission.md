The characters are meant to locate a hand held mirror. This mirror, unknown to the characters is a mirror of imprisonment.

This mirror holds a small Yuan-Ti Pureblood child. This child is linked to the [[Children of the Obsidian Sun]]. This group is largely focused in bringing back the main BBEG of the campaign, and links the characters together in their effort to push forward in the campaign.

If one of the players looks into the mirror, it will show a reflection, but not necessarily their own. If they pick up a mirror, and look into it, they will see the reflection of a small Yuan-Ti girl crying, they must succeed on a dc 15 constitution saving throw or be pulled into the mirror, swapping places with the girl inside.

If they try and break the mirror, they must roll higher than an 11 on their attack or it will clink off the mirror and do no damage, if they do the glass shatters, and the encased creature is ejected out into the nearest space available.
