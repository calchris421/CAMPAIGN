Elven woman commands a presence both unnervingly elegant and profoundly unsettling. Here’s how she might appear:

**Eyes:** Her gaze is a trap of shifting hues—deep crimson flares in the darkness, but in candlelight, it fades to an almost luminescent gold, veined with streaks of black like cracks in porcelain. When she speaks, shadows seem to pulse in her irises, alive with unseen whispers.

**Hair:** Long and sleek, cascading in deep obsidian waves. The strands glimmer like ink under the moon, with faint streaks of dark violet threading through—almost imperceptible until caught in firelight.

**Skin:** Pale, nearly translucent, yet touched by an unnatural warmth—like porcelain kissed by embers. Symbols, seemingly burned into her flesh, trace eldritch patterns along her collarbones and wrists, flickering as though alive when she calls upon her patron.

**Frame & Presence:** Her stature is lithe, bordering on ethereal—an unsettling contradiction of fragility and undeniable power. When she moves, it is with unearthly grace, each step as measured as a ritual. She drapes herself in ceremonial layers—black silks and crimson-gilded embroidery, adorned with rings and talismans too old to have rightful names.

**Voice:** Smooth and intoxicating, carrying the weight of promises best left unspoken. There’s a faint undertone—a whispering resonance beneath her words, as though she’s never truly speaking alone.
