Birodal’s relentless heartbeat where the clash of waves meets the clatter of industry, and where the city’s laborers, artisans, and sea-worn workers carve out a living amid salt and sweat. Unlike the grand promenades where wealth dictates elegance, The Onynade is raw, alive, and deeply proud of its grit.

### **District Atmosphere**

Winding streets of damp cobblestone twist through multi-tiered buildings, their wooden beams darkened by sea air and time. Ropes crisscross above the alleys like veins of a living entity, suspending pulley systems that hoist cargo from one level to the next—creating a **vertical economy**, where goods are traded not just street-to-street, but balcony-to-balcony.

The sound of hammering and sawing echoes through the docks, where shipwrights craft sturdy vessels in open-air workshops, their hands stained with oil and pitch. **Tide-driven mills churn with a constant, rhythmic groan**, harnessing the power of the sea to fuel both industry and invention. Lantern-lit markets thrive in old repurposed hulls, selling everything from fresh catch to artisanal brasswork.

But beneath its industrious exterior, The Onynade has **its own unwritten codes**—a deep loyalty among its people, a silent understanding that those who toil together survive together. Outsiders who don’t respect its customs often find themselves met with sharp gazes… or mysteriously delayed shipments.

### **Key Landmarks**

- **The Spillway** – A massive canal system that doubles as an underground market when the tide is low, revealing hidden stalls where smugglers peddle rare imports.
    
- **The Red Rope Tavern** – The unofficial beating heart of the district, a gathering place for dockhands, shipwrights, and sailors who exchange both trade and tales over salt-rimmed tankards.
    
- **The Mast Yard** – A towering scaffolding system where ships are repaired mid-construction, workers scaling ladders like spiders as they piece together the hulls of grand vessels.
    
- **The Rusted Anchor** – A grimy but famed forge that specializes in sturdy tools, ship fittings, and intricate metalcraft often mistaken for noblework.
    
- **The Sunken Vault** – A subterranean warehouse where goods are stored below sea level, accessible only at certain tides—known for its secretive auctions and black-market dealings.
    

### **Notable Figures**

- **Reeve Marek "Lowtide" Holloway** – The unofficial leader of The Onynade, a hardened yet fair man who ensures the laborers are paid their due and outsiders respect the district's ways.
    
- **Vanna Brigsail** – A master shipwright known for designing unconventional hulls that cut through storms like a blade, drawing patrons from every corner of Birodal.
    
- **Jaskir Vost** – A cunning tide broker who **knows the rhythms of the sea better than anyone**, predicting when trade ships should arrive—or when rivals’ vessels might mysteriously lose course.
    
- **Old Threska** – The wise and grizzled merchant whose fresh fish stands at The Spillway have been around longer than some of Birodal’s noble families; her prices are fair, but her judgment is brutal.
    
- **Calo "The Ropes" Vex** – A notorious middleman who deals in unregistered cargo, passing shipments seamlessly from guild to guild without ever leaving a trace on official ledgers.
    

The **Onynade** is more than a simple harbor district—it is **the muscle behind Birodal’s maritime economy**, its people the lifeblood of its industry. They do not wear wealth in jewels or silk, but in calloused hands, sharp instincts, and the quiet certainty that the city would crumble without their toil.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Beneath the industrious hum of **The Onynade**, shadows coil in forgotten corners, and dangers lurk where the tides leave their secrets behind.

### **Hidden Dangers of The Onynade**

- **The Drowned Archive** – Beneath the streets lies an ancient, waterlogged vault, rumored to hold relics long forbidden by Birodal’s elite. Some say the books within whisper to those who linger too long, their pages inked with something older than reason.
    
- **Tide-Eaten Warrens** – A maze of abandoned canals that once served as the backbone of the harbor’s infrastructure, now claimed by smugglers and lost souls. No one maps its tunnels—those who do tend not to return.
    
- **The Black Salt Syndicate** – A clandestine guild of laborers, thieves, and dockmasters who decide which cargo flows freely and which mysteriously sinks. Their power runs deeper than any official ledger.
    
- **The Wailing Piers** – Old, crumbling docks where ships that met mysterious fates were once moored. At night, the wind plays tricks—or perhaps not—making the rotting boards groan like the voices of the lost.
    
- **The Rust-Lung Curse** – Dockworkers whisper about a strange affliction that clings to those who delve too deep into forbidden salvage. A slow, choking ailment that fills the lungs with the scent of salt and decay.
    
- **The Lantern-Keepers** – Mysterious figures seen only at dawn, tending to dim blue-flamed lanterns hung along the oldest piers. Some say they are guardians… others claim they are marking places where something still waits beneath the tides.
    

The **Onynade** is a district that thrives on grit and resilience, but to the unwary, its hidden depths can pull them below, where names are washed away just as surely as footprints in the surf.

Ah, to know **The Onynade’s** secrets is to understand the rhythm of its tides—not just the water, but the ebb and flow of power, whispered deals, and long-buried legends.

### **Secret Networks of The Onynade**

- **The Dockside Ledger** – Not all ships arrive on official records. There exists a second, hidden list, managed by an underground network of dockmasters who control which vessels get **"forgotten"** in bureaucratic filings, allowing discreet goods to move unhindered.
    
- **The Brine Circle** – A covert guild of **tidemasters**, individuals who have spent generations studying the rhythm of the waters. Some say they can predict tempests, while others whisper that their knowledge stems from something deeper—something that sees beneath the tide.
    
- **The Underwake Syndicate** – A faction that deals exclusively in **lost cargo**, retrieving artifacts, trade goods, and sometimes entire sunken shipments before anyone else realizes they’re missing. Their divers work by lantern light, never speaking of what they see beneath the waves.
    
- **The Nightgale Courier Network** – A discreet system of message runners who know every crevice, shortcut, and hidden tunnel within The Onynade. They deliver sealed letters with such precision that not even the most influential spies can intercept their routes.
    

### **The Lost Legend of The Wraithwake**

Every harbor district has its myths, but The Onynade’s most infamous story is that of **The Wraithwake**, a ship said to have vanished mid-berth before its cargo could be unloaded.

Its final records show that it was carrying rare obsidian cargo from a land that no living merchant had ever documented. When it arrived, dockworkers noted its **unnatural silence**—no crew visible, no figures at the helm. Then, as the fog rolled in, it was simply **gone**.

Strangely, **pieces of its hull appear in different places throughout the district**, embedded in building foundations or tucked behind old crates. No one knows how they got there. Some claim The Wraithwake **never sank**, only passed beyond the veil of sight, waiting for the right hands to unearth its true nature.

### **Rumors of the Tidelock Vault**

Deep beneath The Onynade, past forgotten canals and waterlogged chambers, lies a structure known only in whispers—the **Tidelock Vault**.

Supposedly built **before Birodal itself**, this submerged chamber is said to house **a sealed relic that keeps the waters at bay**, ensuring the harbor never floods beyond its limits. The question, of course, is: **who locked it**, and what happens if it ever opens?

Some believe that the Brine Circle keeps watch over it, ensuring that no one disrupts its purpose. Others claim that something inside still **stirs**, waiting for the right moment to pull The Onynade—and all its people—into the depths.

Would you like me to expand on the Tidelock Vault, or perhaps uncover some of the forces that **actively seek to open it**?
