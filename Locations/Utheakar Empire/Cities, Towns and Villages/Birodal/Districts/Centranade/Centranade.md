Floating upon the tides, **The Centranade gleams like an ethereal beacon**, its vast spires **woven with arcane inscriptions** that shimmer in twilight. **A sprawling marble platform**, suspended by unseen forces, serves as the foundation for grand citadels, their walls laced with veins of **blue and gold light**, pulsing softly with residual magic.

Instead of traditional bridges, access to The Centranade is granted by **runed causeways**, activated only by those bearing the sigil of Birodal’s mage-rulers. Beneath its surface, **a shifting undercurrent of ley energy** hums, ensuring that the district remains **unmoored yet perfectly stable**, responding to the will of its Archmages rather than the whims of nature.

- **The Meridian Vaults** – A restricted repository of **arcane relics and artifacts**, too dangerous or powerful to be used without oversight. Some say objects here shape the tides themselves.
    
- **The Ethereal Court** – A judicial chamber where **lawbreakers are judged not by conventional means, but through arcane trials** that reveal truths hidden from ordinary perception.
