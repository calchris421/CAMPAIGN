A **grand tribunal chamber**, floating above a **rippling pool of ley-infused water**, where high crimes against the Mageocracy are judged. Unlike traditional courts, **sentences here are dictated not by mortal law, but by magical resonance**, ensuring the truth cannot be concealed.

- **The Verdict Tides** – The waters beneath the court shift in response to **deception, corruption, and magical imbalance**, revealing **evidence unseen by the mortal eye**.
    
- **The Tidal Convergence Ritual** – Held on rare celestial alignments, where **the ley currents themselves dictate new magical regulations**, bypassing even the Archmages’ authority.
