A **hidden vault**, suspended in the depths below The Centranade, where **forbidden relics, unstable enchantments, and arcane anomalies** are locked away. Entry is permitted only to those who **carry the Mageocracy’s highest authority**.

- **The Vault of Unwritten Magic** – Where spells and enchantments deemed **too dangerous to exist in formal archives** are stored, bound in layered arcane seals.
    
- **The Mirrorbound Prison** – A containment chamber where **beings of immense magical influence are sealed**, ensuring their power remains inaccessible to those who would misuse it.
