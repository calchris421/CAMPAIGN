- Nice looking building located in the Southern Section of the Po'Artis Center, located just a few blocks from the seaside.

The building is set on heavy stone blocks that provide the foundation to the home. This appears to be so that when flooding occurs during the warmer seasons it does not become unlike Venice during these high tides. These rivers become a network of commerce, trade, and transportation within the city. During high tide the city becomes far more busy that normal as it is the best time to try and get things done.

The building itself is beautiful. Thin glass windows line the upper floors, most likely to keep out the cold of the winter months. The building itself is made out of a rich wood and stone mixture of Fachwerk (fa-ch-vairk) architecture that seems to explode with warm autumn like colors as it gets to an overhang that provides a covered walkway underneath the front of the house. This all leads to a roof that is steeply pitched, with a combination of points that protrude from a variety of external tower like structures and the main part of the home that comes to a tall peak. Over the door is a crest depicting a moonlike crescent that is turned so both points are arching upward, with two arrows pointing in opposite directions adjacent to both the top and bottom of the crescent.  The front lawn is basically nonexistent, with a nice fenced in area with a small set of a table and chairs.
