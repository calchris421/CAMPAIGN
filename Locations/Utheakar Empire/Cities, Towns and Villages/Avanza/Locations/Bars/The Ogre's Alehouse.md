**Grimm Barnaby**- Standing at an imposing 6 feet 6 inches tall, the barhand is an unmistakable presence in the tavern. His muscular frame suggests years of hard labor and brawling, evident in the bulging arms and broad chest that fill out a once-fitted tunic, now stretched to its limits. A rugged face, adorned with a few scars and a heavy five o'clock shadow, adds to his intimidating aura. His close-cropped, salt-and-pepper beard frames a set of piercing steel-gray eyes that seem to miss nothing in the establishment.

A deep, booming voice resonates from his barrel-chested form, capable of quelling even the rowdiest patrons with a single word. He wears a well-worn leather apron, stained with a myriad of spills from years of service, suggesting his role as both a barhand and protector of the establishment. A hefty club, hanging from his belt, tells of his ability to handle trouble swiftly.

Despite his imposing appearance, there's an air of gruff warmth to him. He has an easy smile for those who treat the tavern with respect, and he's known to share a tale or a jest with regulars. The barhand is a walking legend within the tavern, a silent guardian who ensures that patrons can revel in their merriment without crossing the line.

**Finnick Quickfingers** - The pint-sized nightshift barhand of the establishment. Standing at a mere 4 feet tall, Finnick is a bundle of energy and enthusiasm. His slender frame is quick on its feet, darting around the tavern with agility that seems almost magical. His mop of unruly red hair and freckles give him a mischievous, youthful appearance, and his bright green eyes sparkle with curiosity.

Finnick is known for his lightning-fast service, especially when it comes to delivering drinks and snacks to patrons in dimly lit corners. He's a master of sleight of hand tricks, often surprising customers with amusing coin tricks and disappearing acts. Despite his size, he possesses a booming voice that can cut through the night's revelry, ensuring that orders are heard and delivered accurately.

His attire is a mix of mismatched items â€“ an oversized apron cinched at the waist and a colorful assortment of vests that he claims to have "acquired" during his travels. He's as much an entertainer as a barhand, regaling the night crowd with humorous stories and jokes, leaving everyone in stitches.

Finnick Quickfingers is the heart and soul of the night shift, making sure the late-night patrons have a memorable time in the tavern with laughter and libations.
