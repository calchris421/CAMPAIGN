_Exterior_: The Rugged Wayfarer stands as a beacon of refuge on the edge of a bustling crossroads. The large, two-story stone building is framed with sturdy oak beams, its exterior weathered by countless years of braving the elements. A sign depicting a wayfarer’s staff and a mountain range, crafted with intricate metalwork, hangs above the heavy, double wooden doors. Ivy creeps up the walls, and lanterns flicker with warm light, inviting weary travelers to rest their feet.

_Ground Floor_:

- **Common Room**: Upon entering, visitors are greeted by a vast common room with a high, vaulted ceiling and a grand stone fireplace at the far end. The crackling fire casts a cozy glow, illuminating long wooden tables and benches scattered throughout the space. The smell of roasting meats and freshly baked bread fills the air. Shelves lined with tankards and bottles of ale hint at the wide selection of beverages available. Above the fireplace, a tapestry depicting the rugged landscape of the nearby mountains adds a touch of local charm.
    
- **Bar**: The bar is a large, polished wooden counter, behind which stands an array of kegs and bottles. The innkeeper, a burly, grizzled man with a twinkle in his eye, serves patrons with a hearty laugh and a tale or two.
    
- **Kitchen**: Behind the bar, the kitchen is a hive of activity. Cooks bustle about, preparing hearty stews, pies, and other rustic dishes. The clatter of pots and pans mixes with the hum of conversation from the common room.
    
- **Stage**: At one corner of the common room, there’s a small stage where bards and minstrels perform nightly, providing entertainment to the inn's guests.
    

_Upper Floor_:

- **Guest Rooms**: A wooden staircase leads to the upper floor, where numerous guest rooms await. Each room is simple yet comfortable, with a sturdy bed, a small table, and a washbasin. The rooms are named after various local landmarks, such as “The Frost Peak Suite” and “The Whispering Glen Room.”
    
- **Private Dining Room**: For travelers seeking a bit more privacy, there is a private dining room available for rent. It’s a cozy space with a round table, plush chairs, and a small fireplace, perfect for private meetings or intimate gatherings.
    
- **Bathhouse**: At the end of the hallway on the upper floor, the inn features a bathhouse with large wooden tubs. Heated by a series of enchanted stones, the water is always warm and soothing, offering guests a chance to unwind and relax.
    

_Cellar_:

- **Storage**: Beneath the inn, the cellar stores barrels of ale, wine, and other provisions. The cool, damp air preserves the quality of the food and drink. There are also a few secret nooks where the innkeeper hides his stash of rare spirits and valuable treasures.
