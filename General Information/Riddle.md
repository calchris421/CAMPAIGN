### Puzzle: The Clockwork Mechanism

**Background:** In an ancient, abandoned workshop, your players discover a complex clockwork mechanism that guards a valuable treasure. To unlock the treasure, they need to solve a series of puzzles involving gears, levers, and time.

**Objective:** Solve the mechanical puzzles to unlock the hidden treasure.

**Puzzle Components:**

1. **The Gear Code:**
    
    - The players find a large gear puzzle on the wall, with a series of interlocking gears. Each gear is marked with a different symbol: a sun, a moon, a star, and a comet.
        
    - Clue: "Align the gears to mark the passage of time, from dawn to dusk, and night will shine."
        
    - Players must align the gears in the correct order: Sun (morning), Star (midday), Moon (evening), Comet (night). When aligned correctly, the mechanism will reveal a hidden compartment containing a key.
        
### Additional Challenge:

- **Mechanical Guardians:**
    
    - The workshop is protected by clockwork constructs that activate if the players take too long or make mistakes. These constructs can be deactivated by finding and pulling hidden switches in the room.
