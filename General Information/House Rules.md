## Combat:
- Inspiration can be used to trigger a re-roll, as well as Conferring Advantage
- Humor is your best friend, if you miss terribly, then make light of it. Remember, we are all here to have fun!
---
## Death Saves:
- Death saves are done in private, meaning:
	- When making a death save, the character will make their save and will inform the DM.
	- When the character critically succeeds a death save, this will be informed to the party, as well as when the member reaches three failed death saves.

## Out of Combat:
- The group is capable of giving a character within the party inspiration, meaning:
	- Upon certain circumstances, the DM will award players a point of inspiration, meaning that role-playing can provide a crucial role to the combat experience.
- Automatic successes can occur for those who have extremely high levels of creativity in their process of performing an action. This hopefully encourages the players to use their brains to think of creative ways to perform said actions.

## Alignment
- For the purposes of long-term campaigns, I will not allow the following alignments:
	- Lawful Evil
	- Neutral Evil
	- Chaotic Evil
- The reasoning for this, in the frame of a long-term campaign, is that Evil-aligned characters are unlikely to work well with other members of the party. It would create unnecessary difficulties in the parties efforts to progress the story. As such I do not allow it.

### Roleplaying
- D&D is a roleplaying game, no single person is the main character. People who are being overbearing, controlling, or forceful at the table with their fellow players are not being a team player.
	- Remember, you are not the only person trying to have fun. Every character in my campaign has their own stories.
