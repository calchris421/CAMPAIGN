Prep: 
	What is the mission?
	- Mission giver: [[Sir Benedict Chevalier]]
- In a coastal town by the name of Avanza. It is largely an import town based around the import of various fish and other sea-faring goods. The town itself is considered quite rough and tumble outside of the inner traders guild, who attempt to retain some control over the city itself. This city is quite large, with a population of nearing 100,000, most of which are seasonal workers who find themselves elsewhere during the colder winter months. You are in the city for reasons that are unique to each of your characters, but all revolve around a job posting which tells of a reward of 100 GP for your assistance with a retrieval of an item which is going to be explained further upon your first meeting. The day of this meeting is to be the day of our first session, and you all have decent knowledge of where to meet with them, at the Hillcross Manor.

It’s autumn, and there is an eerie quiet to the town, the smell of the ocean hangs in the air. The gnome is situated in front of their favorite bar. We are in the town of Avanza. We are responding to a job posting that offers a 100 gp for the retrieval of an item. the barhand Grimm Barnaby? looks to be orcish and is v tall. Greets the gnomish dude, they know one another. the place is kinda gross :/

Next we shift over to Freyr. It's early morning, still in the wee hours of the morning, in their sleep. They’re awoken to a cold floor, thrown from her bed in a rocking ship. Just recently arrived in Avanza. It’s quite warm, because of the stark difference of the coldness of the sea. The docks are bustling. Kind of have to shove through a crowd. Greeted with a bit of a market area, isn’t opened yet, but people are moving around, going about their day. On the way, they see a person, Elias. Freyr spots a twink :) 

Elias is breathing in the air, enjoying being back on home turf. Freyr spots them, but ducks their head down and keeps walking, not wanting that kind of attention. There are several shops on the way to the bar where the job is at. They enter the bar, they’re met with a very strong smell, a mixture of vomit and alcohol. There are a couple of patrons there. A few people seem to have been here for a long while. The barkeep kicks them out. The barkeeper hands them a drink, and he’s almost sure that it isn’t alcohol. 

Fenrir is also at the docks, but opposite of Freyr, smiles and waves, trying to look approachable. He is looking around trying to find the bar he is supposed to go to for this upcoming job. As he is making his way, he too sees a variety of shops. His attention is drawn to fires and the smell of cooking fish. Fenrir bumps into Elias. They introduce themselves to one another. Fenrir asks about Ogre’s Ale House. Elias treats Fenrir to a piece of fish as they make their way to the bar together.

Elias seems to know the barkeep and is enough of a regular to get treated like a familiar friend. Also treats Fenrir to a drink. The alcohol that Fenrir drinks is kind of sweet? Too sweet, almost. It’s very strong. 

In the doorway is a person, they approach from behind. Zillen might have also seen this person walk in. They wear a dark cloak pulled up over their body, not a looming stature, it's thin, not frail but just thin. They slide a paper to Freyr to one side, and the duo of Elias and Fenrir on the other side. A piece of paper is also slid to Zillen in some way. the person looks elvish in nature. the pieces of paper say “are you ready?”

the elven person gets up and starts to make their way out of the bar. Freyr follows the figure, Fenrir too, Elias gets up and leaves as well. Elias, Fenrir and Freyr have a little bit of an interaction, they still follow the person. Zillen is stealthing along, unbeknownst to us. 

The figure is heading down towards the docks, towards the edge of the city. We are brought through the town, it's strange that people almost don't seem to mind this person at all. Freyr sends out Brontë to follow the person to not lose sight of the person. 

We enter a more affluent part of the city. As we make our way through, Elias recognizes this as the Poartic Center, the crowd has thinned out. People are dressed much, much nicer, mostly guild clothing as well. Cloaks just a few inches above the knee (above the knee, how scandalous, I can see their ankles :D)

As we make our way through town, we come upon a larger manor, this is most likely the meeting location, also known as the Hillcross Manor. The manor seems to be slowly taken over by nature, but it's also still ordered and neat. the person enters the manor, we follow behind, slightly awkwardly. 

as Elias knocks, it clicks and opens. The figure makes eye contact with Zillen, showing him that he’s been spotted as well. We are all invited in. The inside of the manor has multiple portraits. These portraits are of a variety of historical figures, can’t quite parse the names together. but they do have a slight familiarity to them. we’re brought to a large den where there’s a fire roaring.

There is a man sitting in a chair, kind of on the older side as he’s graying, also seems to have seen some shit since he has several scars and has calloused hands.  There is a symbol on a tabard? The symbol appears to be a large bear's mouth, around it there are intertwined bars of metal, behind the bear there are two crossing arrows. This is something to do with Laws of nature/protection, as well as the ideals of the god of Reign. a handful of gods are based in the realm of protection, but generally in this area there is more likely to be worship for the god lathander. also known as the Morninglord.

The man looks at us with a bit of intrigue. Stops on Zillen for a moment there, gives him a look and says to us all “we have a lot to talk about, why don’t you take a seat?” He offers to talk about what this job is about. Next to his chair there is a table, on the table are a couple of objects. He walks up to the table, and unfurls a large map. We can see it’s a map of the town, and its surrounding area. He begins to sketch out a simple hand mirror. 

He says “this is an item that is going to be on a shipment coming into town through land. I need this item to be retrieved for me, and it should be coming in within the next day or so. The only problem is that we might be met with some resistance. The item is important to him, hence the pay coming along with this job.”

He pulls out a sack of coins, first 25 gp up front. and the rest when we complete the job. The sketch shows us a very intricate hand mirror. in the top seems to be a green jewel surrounded by two yellow ones on the top? Looks to be expensive, but also quite fragile. He points to a trail on the east side of the city. This is where the shipment will come in. We can acquire the mirror by any means. The man hints at us to leave. the figure we had followed, is called Hatchet? 

They look v different now, they have a beak and feathers, they’re a Kenku. 

Freyr took the sketch of the mirror, but now it's gone, Zillen took it, they don't know lol. 

The shipment is going to come in, in two days time. So we decide to go off and do something around the town first. we get invited into an alley to first get introduced to Zillen officially. In the middle of doing that, we see a bandit trying to rob a merchant, so we decide to step in.

There ended up being 4 bandits and a bandit captain. It took a bit, but in the end we beat them. people went up to the merchant and helped him out. Zillen instead went off to look through the bandit bodies and hid again. [he got a parrying dagger and some gold] 

The Tears have seemed way more aggressive as of late. They’re a problem all the time. The tears are more of a nuisance gang, a mixture of low lives, all signified with a teardrop that is tattooed somewhere on their chest. This group tends to target people that the policing force wouldn't really notice, or maybe even care for?

months ago, this didn't happen as commonly, so it isn’t really known yet if this is a common occurrence.

**A convo between Zillen and the party happens again, trying to continue it from before the bandit interruption. Elias is very intent on staring at Zillen’s eyes.**
