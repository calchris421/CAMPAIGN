9. **Orb of Dragonkin:** While known for its ability to control dragons, the orb also contains immense draconic energy that can be harnessed by the wielder.
10. **Phylactery of Positive Channeling:** This item increases the amount of positive energy channeled by clerics, which can be used for healing or harming undead.
